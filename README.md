# CamBuster

This project consists in a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Tensorflow. The AI vision is aimed at categorizing pictures containing cameras on the streets such as CCTV surveillance cameras. The goal is to automatize the process of mapping all the cameras using pictures snapped from google street view.
